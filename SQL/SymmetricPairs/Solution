You are given a table, Functions, containing two columns: X and Y.



Two pairs (X1, Y1) and (X2, Y2) are said to be symmetric pairs if X1 = Y2 and X2 = Y1.

Write a query to output all such symmetric pairs in ascending order by the value of X.

20 20
20 21
22 23


Solution:

SELECT T.X, T.Y FROM (SELECT A.X, A.Y FROM FUNCTIONS A INNER JOIN FUNCTIONS B ON A.X = B.Y AND A.Y = B.X AND A.X < A.Y UNION SELECT X, Y FROM FUNCTIONS A WHERE 1=1 AND X=Y GROUP BY X,Y HAVING COUNT(*) > 1) T ORDER BY T.X, T.Y;
