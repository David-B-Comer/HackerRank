A median is defined as a number separating the higher half of a data set from the lower half. Query the median of the Northern Latitudes (LAT_N) from STATION and round your answer to  decimal places.

Input Format

The STATION table is described as follows:

Station.jpg

where LAT_N is the northern latitude and LONG_W is the western longitude.

Solution:

SELECT ROUND(S.LAT_N,4) MEDIAM FROM STATION S WHERE (SELECT COUNT(LAT_N) FROM STATION WHERE LAT_N < S.LAT_N ) = (SELECT COUNT(LAT_N) FROM STATION WHERE LAT_N > S.LAT_N);
