Explanation

The first column is an alphabetically ordered list of Doctor names.
The second column is an alphabetically ordered list of Professor names.
The third column is an alphabetically ordered list of Singer names.
The fourth column is an alphabetically ordered list of Actor names.
The empty cell data for columns with less than the maximum number of names per occupation (in this case, the Professor and Actor columns) are filled with NULL values.


Solution:

SET @R1=0, @R2=0, @R3=0, @R4=0; SELECT MIN(Doctor), MIN(Professor), MIN(Singer), MIN(Actor) FROM (SELECT CASE WHEN Occupation='Doctor' THEN (@R1:=@R1+1) WHEN Occupation='Professor' THEN (@R2:=@R2+1) WHEN Occupation='Singer' THEN (@R3:=@R3+1) WHEN Occupation='Actor' THEN (@R4:=@R4+1) END AS RowNumber, CASE WHEN Occupation='Doctor' THEN Name END AS Doctor, CASE WHEN Occupation='Professor' THEN Name END AS Professor, CASE WHEN Occupation='Singer' THEN Name END AS Singer, CASE WHEN Occupation='Actor' THEN Name END AS Actor FROM OCCUPATIONS ORDER BY Name)Temp GROUP BY RowNumber;
